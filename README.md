# Pci-Target-Device-
A Verilog Project To Create a  PCI Target Device with many scenarios of reading and writing Data to and from a buffer in the device with a condition that if the data to be written to the buffer is greater than his size a larger buffer will store the previous data and during the transfer of data TRDY=1 as an active low signal until transfer is completed, We Test it Using Test Benches That act as a Master Device .
